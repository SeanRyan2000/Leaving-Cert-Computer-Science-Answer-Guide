Open the program called Question16_B.py from your device. This file
only contains two comments on lines 1 and 2.
Before making any changes, you should use the format
CandidateNumberQuestion16_B.py to save your file. For example, you
would save the file as 123456Question16_B.py if your candidate
number was 123456.
Enter your Examination Number in the space provided on Line 2.



Implement a program for a temperature alert system for a baby’s room.
You should use comments throughout your program to explain your code. You may wish to
reuse some of the code you used in part (a) as part of your solution.
Your program should do the following:


 Display a message which outputs “Welcome to Temperature Alert System”.
 Ask the user to enter a temperature value in degrees Celsius. An example of how this
might look is shown below.
Enter temperature value in degrees Celsius: 22
 Use a conditional statement to output different pieces of information based on the
temperature value that has been input by the user. See the table below for conditions
and the outputs that should be displayed. 

            Condition               |               Output
    Temperature is less than 20     |       Too cold. Turn up heating. 
    Temperature between 20 – 24     |       Temperature is just right. 
    Temperature is more than 24     |       Too warm. Turn down heating. 



An example output is shown below.
Welcome to Temperature Alert System
Enter temperature value in degrees Celsius: 22
Temperature is just right.
