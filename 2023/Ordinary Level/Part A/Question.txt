Open the program called Question16_A.py from your device. The
source code is shown and described briefly below.

the file using the format CandidateNumberQuestion16_A.py. For
example, you would save the file as 123456Question16_A.py if your

The program below produces a times table for a specific number. A times table is a
multiplication table in a list that shows the multiples of a specific number. The code below
works by using a for loop to multiply the number seven by zero, then by one, then by two
until the loop repeats ten times in total.
    # Question 16(a)
    # Examination Number:

    print("Multiplication program")

    number = 7

    print("Multiplications of ", number)

    for i in rang(0):
        print(number*i
