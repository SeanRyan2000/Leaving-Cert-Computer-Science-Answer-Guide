# Question 16(a)
# Examination Number:


# Make the following changes to the program:

# Currently the program has no way of ending unless the user guesses the secret number.
# Change the program so that it does not allow the user more than three guesses. This is
# the value currently being passed into the function.
# Hint: You will need to change the loop so that it continues as long as the userâ€™s guess
# is not equal to the secret number and the number of guesses is less than
# max_guesses_allowed
