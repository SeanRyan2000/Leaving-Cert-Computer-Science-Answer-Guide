Question:
Open the program called Question16_A.py from your device. The
source code is shown below.
Before making any changes, you should save your working copy of
the file using the format ExaminationNumberQuestion16_A.py.
For example, you would save the file as 123456Question16_A.py if
your Examination Number was 123456.
Enter your Examination Number in the space provided on line 2 in
your Python file.
The program defines a function called guess_game which simulates a guessing
game.
When the function is called, the program generates a secret number between 1 and 5
inclusive. This is stored in a variable called secret_number.
The program then enters a loop in which the user is prompted to guess the number.
The user’s guess is stored in the variable user_guess. Every time the user enters a
guess the program increases the variable guess_count by one. If the user’s guess
matches the computer’s secret number, the message ‘Congratulations! You win!’ is
displayed. The loop continues until the user guesses the secret number.
# Question 16(a)
# Examination Number:
from random import randint

def guess_game(max_guesses_allowed):

    secret_number = randint(1, 5)
    guess_count = 0
    user_guess = 0

    while (user_guess != secret_number):

        user_guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
        guess_count += 1 #Increase guess_count by 1
        if user_guess == secret_number:
            print("Congratulations! You win!")

print("Welcome to the guessing game!")
guess_game(3)
