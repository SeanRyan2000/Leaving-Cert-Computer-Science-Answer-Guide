Open the program called Question16_B.py from your device. This file contains only
two comments, on lines 1 and 2.
Before adding any code, you should save your working copy of the file using the
format ExaminationNumberQuestion16_B.py. For example, you would save the file as
123456Question16_B.py if your Examination Number was 123456.
Enter your Examination Number in the space provided on line 2 in your Python file.
Implement a number guessing game in Python. The game requires the user to guess a
random number between 1 and 100 and they are awarded points based on how close
they get to the number.
You should use comments throughout your program to explain your code. You may
wish to reuse some of the code you used in part (a) as part of your solution.
The game should proceed according to the following sequence:
 The user’s score is set to zero.
 At the start of every new round the computer generates a random number
between 1 and 100. This is the secret number that the user is trying to guess.
 The user is then prompted to enter a guess as shown below.
Enter your guess:
 Calculate the difference between the secret number and the user guess.
 The numbers are then displayed in a meaningful message on a single line as
shown below.
Secret number is 55. You guessed 50. Difference is 5.
 The numbers are compared and the score is updated according the following
rules:
o If the user’s guess and the secret number are the same then the score is
increased by 100 and the message "JACKPOT!!! You score 100 points" is
displayed.
o If the user’s guess is within 20 (either side) of the secret number the user’s
score is increased by 20 and the message "You score 20 points" is displayed.
o If the user’s guess is more than 30 away from the secret number the user’s
score is decreased by 30 and the message "You lose 30 points" is displayed.
 At the end of each round the score is displayed and user is prompted with the
message “Play again? (Y/N):”
 The game ends when the user enters anything other than the single letter ‘Y’.
An example output is shown on the next page.
