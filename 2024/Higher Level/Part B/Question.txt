Open the program called Question16_B.py from your device.
This file contains only two comments, on lines 1 and 2.
Before adding any code, you should save your working copy
of the file using the format
ExaminationNumberQuestion16_B.py. For example, you
would save the file as 123456Question16_B.py if your
Examination Number was 123456.
Enter your Examination Number in the space provided on line 2 in your Python file.


Implement a simulation of a fruit machine in Python.
You should use comments throughout your program to explain your code. You may
wish to reuse some of the code you used in part (a) as part of your solution.

The program should proceed according to the following sequence:
 Initialise a list called fruits with three elements – apple, cherry and orange.

 Display the initial list of fruits as shown.

The initial list of fruits is:
['apple', 'cherry', 'orange']
 Prompt the user to enter an additional fruit, for example kiwi, pear or lemon and
append the value entered to fruits
Enter an additional fruit: kiwi

 Display the list of four fruits, for example:
The list of four fruits is:
['apple', 'cherry', 'orange', 'kiwi']

 Prompt the user to nominate their winning fruit which must be in the above list.
If the user enters a fruit that is not in fruits, the program should display an
error message and prompt the user to nominate their winning fruit again. This
should continue as long as the winning fruit entered is not in fruits.

Nominate your winning fruit: cherry
 Display the winning fruit, as show below.
Nominate your winning fruit: cherry
The winning fruit you selected is cherry

 Write code to select three random fruits from fruits. Compare the selected
fruits to the winning fruit entered earlier and keep going until all three fruits
match the winning fruit.

The program should keep a count of the number of tries taken and display this
with a “Winner” message at the end, as shown below.
Winner after 38 tries
