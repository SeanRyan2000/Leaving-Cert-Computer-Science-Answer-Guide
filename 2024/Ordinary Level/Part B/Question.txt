Implement a program that will help you to split a restaurant bill with your friends.
You should use comments throughout your program to explain your code. You may wish to
reuse some of the code you used in part (a) as part of your solution.

Your program should do the following:
 The program should display an output of “Split Bill Calculator” at the start.
 The user can enter the total amount of the bill.
 The user can enter the number of people that will be splitting the bill.
 Divide the total amount of the bill by the number of people. The amount owed by each
person should be printed with a suitable message.
